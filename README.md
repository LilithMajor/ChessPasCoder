A website with a local playing chess game, elo leaderboard, chats and a forum.

# How to implement

To implement ChessPasCoder you'll need tomcat 8. In the lib/ folder of tomcat add the following jars : 

-java-json.jar
-javax.websocket-api-1.0-rc4.jar
-ojdbc6.jar

In the chess.jsp and index.jsp change the Websocket URI by your own IP adress. (Can be found on windows in the terminal with :"ipconfig").

Have a great game !
